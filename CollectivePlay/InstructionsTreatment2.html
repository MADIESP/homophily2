    </h1>
<br>

<p>Based on your ranking, you will be paired with a partner for 6 rounds. </p>
<p>In every round: </p>
<p> Both of you will see the same table filled with 0s and 1s. </p>
<p>You will have 30 seconds to count all the 0s. </p>
<p>One partner's answer will be randomly chosen as the team's response. </p>
<p>If this answer is correct, both earn 1 point; if not, both earn 0 points. </p>
<p> Afterward, both receive feedback on the team's performance and may exchange a message with their partner. </p>
<p> If you have any question, please raise your hand, and the experimenter will assist you. </p>

<p>We will now walk you through an example to showcase the feedback types and possible messages to send.</p>
<p> Click the button when you are ready to start the example. </p>
