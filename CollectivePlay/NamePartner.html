<p>
 Based on the rankings of this session's participants,  you have been paired with  <b> {{ participant.name_partner }}.</b>
  </p>

   Before moving to Table 1, you will have to guess both your own and {{ participant.name_partner }}'s performance
in Part 2 of the experiment. </p>

<p> For example, if you think you provided 1 correct answer in Part 2, your guess for your own performance should be "1".
Similarly, if you think {{ participant.name_partner }} provided 1 correct answer in Part 2, your guess for {{ participant.name_partner }}'s performance should be "1". </p>

<p> Each correct guess earns you 1 point.</p>

    <p> If you have any question, please raise your hand, and the experimenter will assist you.</p>
