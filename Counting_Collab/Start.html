<p> This is a collective counting game. In each round, you will see a table dividing into two parts, and consisting of randomly ordered 0s and 1s.
</p>
<p>For each table, you will first be given 45s to individually count the number of 0s in both parts of the tables. The total number of 0s (ie, the sum of both parts) will automatically be computed.
</p>
<p>
You will then be able to interact with your partner via a chat to submit only one sum as the group answer.
</p>
<p>
If this sum is correct, you will directly move to the next table.
</p>
<p>
If this sum is not correct, you will have the opportunity to communicate again with your partner via a chat to submit a new answer.
</p>
    <p>You will be given six minutes in total. Accurately count  as many tables as possible  with your partner before the  six minutes run out. </p>



    <p>  Press the button when you are ready to start. </p>
