<p> This is a collective counting game. As in the previous part of the experiment, in each round, you will see a table dividing into two parts, and consisting of randomly ordered 0s and 1s.
</p>
<p>As in the previous part of the experiment, for each table, you will first be given 45s to individually count the number of 0s in both parts of the table. The total number of 0s (ie, the sum of both parts) will automatically be computed.
</p>
<p>
You will then be able to interact with your partner via a chat to submit only one sum as the group answer.
</p>
<p>
If this sum is correct, both you and your partner will earn 2 points and your team will directly move to the next table.
</p>
<p>
If this sum is not correct, you will have the opportunity to communicate again with your partner via a chat to submit a new answer. Both you and your partner will earn 0.5 points if the new sum submitted is correct.
</p>
    <p> There will be 8 rounds. You will therefore have to count 8 different tables. To give you enough time to interact with your partner, you will have 12 minutes to complete the game.  You will receive a messsage when there will be only two minutes left to finish the game.   </p>

<p>
    This is a group counting game with 8 rounds.

</p>

In each round, you'll see a table divided in half, filled with 0s and 1s, just like the previous part.

<p>

First, you have 45 seconds to individually count all the 0s in the table.
</p>


Next, you can chat with your partner to agree on the total numer of 0s to submit as the group's answer.

<p>

If the submitted total is correct, both you and your partner earn 2 points, and your team proceeds to the next table.

</p>

If the total is incorrect, you can chat again to submit a new answer. You both earn 0.5 points if the revised total is correct.

<p>

You have 12 minutes to complete this part.  A message will alert you when there are only 2 minutes left.
</p>
    <p>  Press the button when you are ready to start. </p>
