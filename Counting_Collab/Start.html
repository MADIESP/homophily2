<br>


<p> This is a collective counting game. As in the previous part of the experiment, in each round, you will see a table dividing into two parts, and consisting of randomly ordered 0s and 1s.
</p>
<p>As in the previous part of the experiment, for each table, you will first be given 45s to individually count the number of 0s in both parts of the table. The total number of 0s (ie, the sum of both parts) will automatically be computed.
</p>
<p>
You will then be able to interact with your partner via a chat to submit only one sum as the group answer.
</p>
<p>
If this sum is correct, both you and your partner will earn 2 points and your team will directly move to the next table.
</p>
<p>
If this sum is not correct, you will have the opportunity to communicate again with your partner via a chat to submit a new answer. Both you and your partner will earn 0.25 points if the new sum submitted is correct.
</p>
    <p> There will be 8 rounds. You will therefore have to count 8 different tables. To give you enough time to interact with your partner, you will have 12 minutes to complete the game.  You will receive a messsage when there will be only two minutes left to finish the game.   </p>
