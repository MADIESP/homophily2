<p>
In a  previous session, two female players were assigned the names "Mary" and "Emma";
    and two males players the names "James" and "John".
</p>
<p>
Please rank  them from highest performer (rank 1st) to lowest performer (rank 4th).
    </p>
<p>
You can give the same rank to different players.
    For example, if you think all 4 players performed equally well, select "Rank 1st" for each of them.
    </p>
<p>
You will be paid 50 cents for each correct rank at the end of the experiment.
