{{ block content }}
<p>
In previous sessions, two female players were assigned the names "Mary" and "Emma";
and two males players the names "James" and "John".
</p>
<p>
Please rank these players from highest performer (rank 1st) to lowest performer (rank 4th).
    </p>
<p>
You can give the same rank to different players. In case of a tie, you should select the best ranking.
    For example, if you think all these 4 players performed equally well, select "Rank 1st" for all 4 players.
    </p>
<p>
You will be paid 50 cents for each correct ranking at the end of the experiment.
