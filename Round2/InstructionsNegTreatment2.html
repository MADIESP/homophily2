<p> In this example, you are paired with Mary. </p>


<p> Mary and you have just counted the number of 0s in table 1.</p>

<p> One of your answers was randomly chosen as the team's answer, and this answer is <b> wrong. </b></p>

<p> The identity of the partner whose answer was selected <b> will  be revealed. </b> </p>
<p> The partner whose answer was not selected will select a message from a list and will send it to his/her partner.</p>
