<p> Your ranking will determine your partner in the following manner: </p>

<p> 1- A participant will be randomly selected.</p>

<p> 2- This participant will be paired with their top-ranked partner. </p>

<p> 3- If that partner is already paired, the participant will be paired with their next preferred choice.</p>

<p> 4- Another participant will then be randomly selected.
    This participant will be paired with their top-ranked partner.
    If that partner is already paired, the participant will be paired with their next preferred choice. </p>


<p> 5- This process continues until everyone is paired. </p>


<p> Therefore, the higher you rank a participant, the more likely you are to be matched with that participant.
    </p>

<p> If you have any question, please raise your hand, and the experimenter will assist you. </p>
